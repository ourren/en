It has several years since I began to do some research with security. But actually I did not have any big projects which could be opened to everyone. There are some small projects and tools that I could provide at present.

+ [SecWiki](http://www.sec-wiki.com)
Desribe: the website was builded four years ago, and it generates the latest security news and technology articles (not only China not also the whole world). It has more than 1000 users, 6000+ article links and other materials at present. It also has security skill guide for beginners. And I hope this project could be the most popular website in security zone.
